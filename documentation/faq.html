			<h5>General Questions</h5>
			
			<h6>Why is it called NatTable?</h6>
			<p>NatTable was originally written by Andy Tsoi and dedicated to his girlfriend, Natalie.</p>
			<p>We also sometimes think of 'Nat' as an acronym for 'Not A Table' given that it's really
				more of a data grid, or a tool for building tables/grids.</p>
			
			<h6>How much data can you put behind it?</h6>
			<p>As much as you want, pretty much. The only practical limit right now is that the number 
			of columns, rows, width and height of your table must be able to be represented as 32-bit 
			integers. We test against virtual data sets of 1 million columns by 1 million rows.</p>
